    <ol class="moveTabSpace">
        <li class="orderedList listFont">Problem Formulation </li>
        <p class="tab">They start by defining the problem they want to solve, such as object detection, image classification, or semantic segmentation.</p>

        <li class="orderedList listFont">Dataset Selection</li>
        <p class="tab">Researchers choose appropriate datasets that are relevant to their problem domain. Common datasets include COCO, ImageNet, Pascal VOC, and Cityscapes.</p>
        
        <li class="orderedList listFont">Model Architecture Selection</li>
        <p class="tab">Depending on the problem, researchers select or design a suitable neural network architecture. This could be a convolutional neural network (CNN), a recurrent neural network (RNN), or a combination of both.</p>
        
        <li class="orderedList listFont">Training</li>
        <p class="tab">Researchers train their chosen model on the selected dataset using appropriate optimization algorithms and techniques, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, or RMSprop. They often fine-tune hyperparameters through experimentation.</p>
        
        <li class="orderedList listFont">Validation</li>
        <p class="tab">Once trained, the model is evaluated on a separate validation set to assess its performance. This step helps to identify overfitting and tune model parameters further.</p>
        
        <li class="orderedList listFont">Testing</li>
        <p class="tab">The final step involves testing the model on a held-out test set to evaluate its generalization performance. This step ensures that the model performs well on unseen data.</p>
        
        <li class="orderedList listFont">Analysis and Interpretation</li>
        <p class="tab">Researchers analyze the results, interpret the findings, and compare them with state-of-the-art methods. They may also provide insights into the strengths and limitations of their approach.</p>
        
        <li class="orderedList listFont">Documentation and Publication</li>
        <p class="tab">Finally, researchers document their experiments, results, and conclusions in a paper format suitable for submission to academic conferences or journals. This includes writing the introduction, related work, methodology, results, discussion, and conclusion sections.</p>
    </ol>
    <p>Throughout this process, researchers often iterate on their experiments, refining their approach based on feedback from peers, reviewers, and their own insights.</p>
